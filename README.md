👋 Hi, I’m @misanthropic-codes
👀 I’m interested in web development, particularly development-related projects.
🌱 I’m currently learning CSS, and next I plan to learn JavaScript, the MERN stack, other languages, and DSA. I'm always eager to learn more if needed.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects in JavaScript, as that's what I'm currently focusing on.
📫 How to reach me: email - misanthropic.codes@outlook.com | LinkedIn - Abhishek Kumar
😄 Pronouns: he/him
⚡ Fun fact: I can spend hours debugging code without losing patience, but I can’t stand waiting in line for more than five minutes!
